      question: "How do we integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?",
      answer:
        "Use our GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or GitLab templates to run suites on merge events. Each template injects secrets securely and reports status checks back to your repos automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we simulate multi-region traffic before launching?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Provision parallel orchestrators across up to 12 regions with configurable latency injection, packet loss, and concurrency levels that mimic production workloads.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the suite support contract testing and schema validation?",
      answer:
        "Upload OpenAPI specs or use our runtime DSL to enforce schema rules. We version each contract and alert your teams when breaking changes hit a release branch.",
    },
    {
      question: "How secure are test environments and secret management?",
      answer:
        "Ephemeral environments hydrate secrets through your vault provider. All execution contexts run in isolated sandboxes with signed audit trails.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does onboarding look like for launch partners?",
      answer:
        "You get a dedicated launch architect, white-glove migration, and co-branded marketing assets tailored for your DevOps tool rollout.",
